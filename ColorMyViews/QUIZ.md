# Quiz: ConstraintLayout

## Match the constraint type with its correct description.

```
Fixed constraint: A constraint that is specified using a hard-coded number.
Adaptable constraint: A constraint that defines a relationship in relative and weighted terms.
Absolute positioning: Positioning is numerical, such as the position in x, y coordinates.
Relative positioning: Views are positioned by specifying relationships to other views.
```

## In which of the following situations might it be useful to use ratios for constraining the size of a view or view group?

```
1. A view needs to have a certain aspect ratio to accomodate an image, 
   no matter what the screen orientation or display is.
2. You want to create a layout with squares that is adaptable 
   but forces the squares to square.
3. Your app needs a layout that always matches the aspect ratio of the system camera.

1 and 2 are cases for using ratios.
```

## Match the type of chaining with the correct effect.

```
Spread chain: Elements are spread equally in space.
Packed chain: Elements are packed to use minimum space.
Spread inside chain: Elements are spread to use available space with head and tail attached to the parent.
Packed chain with bias: Elements are packed to use minimum space and are moved on their axis depending on bias.
Weighted chain: Elements are resized to use all available space according to specified weights with head and tail glued to parent.
```
